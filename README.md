# Education Returns in Indian Labor Market

üéì **Portfolio Project #2: Econometric Analysis of Human Capital Returns**

## üìä Project Overview

Comprehensive econometric analysis of education returns in the Indian labor market, examining wage premiums associated with different education levels and demographic characteristics using advanced statistical methods.

## üéØ Key Findings

- **Education Return**: 8.5% wage increase per additional year of education
- **Gender Wage Gap**: 40% premium for male workers (concerning inequality)  
- **Urban Premium**: 35% higher wages in urban areas vs rural
- **Model Performance**: R¬≤ = 0.70 (explains 70% of wage variation)
- **Graduate Premium**: 180% wage premium for graduate+ education vs no education
